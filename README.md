I am a **Bioinformatics enthusiast** Equipped with a strong background in **Bioinformatics** and focus on **Microbiome – Host Interactions, Metagenomic Analysis, and NGS Analysis**. Dedicated researcher have expertise in Linux, Bash Scripting, Machine Learning, and Programming (Python, R).
🔬 Current Projects
ARG-PRISM: A machine learning-based framework for precise identification of antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomes.
Breast Cancer Microbiome Research: Using metagenomic analyses to uncover gut microbiome-metabolite signatures in breast cancer patients. I recently presented this work at the ICiLS-24 conference at ASAB, NUST.
📚 Research Interests
Microbiome-host interactions
Cancer biology (therapy resistance, tumor immunology)
Metagenomics and Antibiotic Resistance
NGS data analysis and multi-omics
Machine learning and computational modeling for biological data
🎓 Education & Accomplishments
Developed bioinformatics pipelines using tools like BWA, BLAST, and Samtools.
Active member of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and Vice President of *ISCB-SC Regional Student Council Pakistan.
